To Do List
<ul>
    <li>Logging - Log all changes in a log database
    <li>Add relational information to database migrations that include cascading deletes when appropriate
    <li>Make use of config variables for the title of the site, default logo, etc. For now, colors and such can be handled in the styles.css; however, certain options for default paging of results would be helpful.
</ul>
