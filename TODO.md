To Do List
<ul>
<li>Authentication
<li>Logging - Log all changes in a log database
 <li>Soft-deletion - implement soft deletion on all tables
 <li>Add relational information to database migrations that include cascading deletes when appropriate
<li>Add sensible data validation for creating and editing of all data (start with retreats)
<li>Switch Innkeeper, Assistant, and Director look ups from being hard coded arrays and using User table to using their respective tables
<li>Create Role and Capability tables so that custom roles can be defined with a variety of capabilities
<li>Learn to make use of config variables for the title of the site, default logo, etc. For now, colors and such can be handled in the styles.css; however, certain options for default paging of results would be helpful.
