	Dear Retreatant, {{ $participant->contact->display_name }}

	On behalf of the Jesuit Community, staff and your retreat director, , please know that we all hope that your recent retreat was truly a transformative experience filled with many graces and a personal encounter with Our Lord. St. Ignatius encourages us to "go forth and set the world on fire!" We hope that you will be inspired to continue to live your life out of the graces received on the retreat. I challenge you to share your experiences with others and thus set their hearts ablaze with a love of the Lord. Your openness to the Spirit at work is both beautiful and inspiring.

	Attached below you will find the picture taken following the retreat. It serves as a reminder of the peace experienced on the retreat and those with whom you experienced this graced time. I encourage you to continue to make time for regular prayer and to pray for one another. If you have a particular intention you would like us to join you in praying for please share that intention with us by completing the online Montserrat Prayer Request.

	We too count on your prayers to continue our ministry. One concrete way that you help Montserrat to grow is to evaluate our efforts. If you were unable to provide feedback before leaving the retreat house, kindly take a moment to complete our online retreat evaluation. We read every evaluation carefully and prayerfully consider how to make Montserrat better. Of course it is never too soon to begin preparing for your next retreat. Next year's retreat (#2019) is from February 14-17, 2019. Click here to register now for Retreat #201910.

	Thank you for joining us at Montserrat Jesuit Retreat House. You can trust that we will continue to remember you in our prayers. May the Lord fulfill the work of grace begun in you!

	Peace - Fr. Anthony Borrow, S.J., Director
